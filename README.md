This is an example of a go application written with the web framework gin.  Bower is used for client side dependencies, gulp is used for the build.  To run locally, clone and run `gulp`.  Similar to a node.js application, the gulp file is set up to detect any changes in server side code, and automatically restart the server.  It's a nice workflow for go based web applications.


Prerequisites:
- go
- nodejs
- gulp
- bower
